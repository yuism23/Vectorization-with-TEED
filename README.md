# Vectorization-with-TEED
This project is a modified version of [PictureVectorization](https://github.com/yuism23/PictureVectorization) and focuses on image processing and vectorization analysis. It leverages the third-party open-source project [TEED](https://github.com/xavysp/TEED) for core functionality.
## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure to complete the following steps:

### Install [TEED](https://github.com/xavysp/TEED):
Clone the TEED repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/xavysp/TEED.git
cd TEED
```

Follow the instructions in the TEED repository to install the necessary dependencies.
### Install Additional Dependencies:

Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your environment:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
you can find 'requirements.txt' in [PictureVectorization](https://github.com/yuism23/PictureVectorization)
## Steps to Run the Project
### 1. Preprocessing
First, run the Preprocess.sh script to prepare the dataset. This will generate initial image processing results and save them under the data folder within the TEED directory.

``` bash
bash Preprocess.sh
```
### 2. Run TEED
Next, navigate to the TEED directory and run the TEED main script main.py to process the data.

``` bash
cd TEED
python main.py --choose_test_data=-1
```
This command will process the images stored in the data folder and produce the output.

### 3. Vectorization
After running TEED, return to the main project directory and run the Vectorize.sh script to vectorize the processed results.

``` bash
bash Vectorize.sh
```
This step will perform vectorization on the data generated by TEED, producing the final vectorized images.

### 4. Visualization
If you want to visualize the results, run the Evaluation.sh script.

``` bash
bash Evaluation.sh
```
This script will evaluate the vectorized images and produce visualization charts.

## Output
- All preprocessing and vectorization results are saved in the data folder under the TEED project directory.
- Visualization results and evaluation charts are saved in the designated output directory.
